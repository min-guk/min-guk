Hello! 🖐

I'm a Master's student at Dankook University in South Korea, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on the exciting convergence of System and AI, with specific emphasis on **ML for Systems** and **Systems for ML**. My key publication, featured at SIGMOD '24, is titled ["Can Learned Indexes be Built Efficiently? A Deep Dive into Sampling Trade-offs"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3654919).

### I am currently looking for a PhD position for 2025!
