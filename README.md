Hi, I’m Minguk Choi! 🖐

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I am pursuing an independent study with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) on systems for machine learning and machine learning for systems. I also continue to collaborate with [Prof. Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/) at TU Berlin on federated learning.

I received my Master’s degree from Dankook University in Korea. My Master’s research focused on storage and database systems, particularly learned index structures, under the supervision of Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/).

Building on this background, my current research interests center on developing scalable and efficient systems for machine learning training, retrieval, and serving.
