Hello! üñê

I'm a Master's student at Dankook University in South Korea, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in [the System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research lies at the exciting intersection of AI and System, with a particular focus on **"Learned Index"** and **"System for ML-Cluster"**. My key publication, featured at SIGMOD '24, is titled ["Can Learned Indexes be Built Efficiently? A Deep Dive into Sampling Trade-offs"](https://2024.sigmod.org/program_sigmod.shtml).

### I am currently looking for a PhD position for 2025!
#### I expect to complete my Master's degree in August 2024.
