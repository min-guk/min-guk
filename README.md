Hello, I'm Minguk Choi! 🖐

I will begin my Ph.D. in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Fall 2025. 

Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Matthias Boehm](https://mboehm7.github.io/) at TU Berlin, while also collaborating with [Dr. Kyoungmin Kim](https://sites.google.com/dblab.postech.ac.kr/kmkim)  at EPFL.


Previously, I earned my Master's degree in August 2024 from Dankook University in Korea, where I had the privilege of being advised by Professors [Seehwan Yoo](https://sites.google.com/site/dkumobileos/members/seehwanyoo) and [Jongmoo Choi](http://embedded.dankook.ac.kr/~choijm/) in the [System Software Laboratory](https://sslab.dankook.ac.kr/).

My research focuses on **scalable and efficient systems for ML training, retrieval, and serving**. Here is my **[CV](./assets/pdf/CV_MingukChoi.pdf)**.

On-going projects:

- **Federated Learning Plan under Privacy Constraints**: Optimized federated execution plans for end-to-end ML pipelines in Apache SystemDS under privacy constraints, using a dynamic programming-based cost model.

- **Hybrid Vector-Relational Search**: An algorithm to optimize multi-vector top-k queries combined with complex relational filters in vector-relational hybrid databases.
